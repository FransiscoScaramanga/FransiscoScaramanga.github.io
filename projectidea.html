<h1>Project Idea – Eat Something New</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The concept is to create an application that evaluates peoples eating habits and tastes and uses this data to recommend dishes from cuisines which they would otherwise be hesitant to try.   The nature of the concept would lend itself well to a mobile application for the diner’s use and perhaps a desktop application for use by restaurants.  The purpose of the facility is to make a small contribution to cultural integration through food.  Besides, there are a whole bunch of recently converted vegans out there that haven’t been introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarati_cuisine">Gujarati food</a>, this is madness!</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>We all eat and from time to time, most of us, eat in a restaurant(Zagat, 2021).  However, while some are adventurous and will try a cuisine that they haven’t before, there are many that will not.  People will often say something along the lines of “I don’t like Indian food”.  When hearing something like this I ask ‘why’? The response is usually that they have tried it once or twice in a restaurant that their friend recommended.  Staying with the example, India is a huge and diverse country, there are many regions and each has a discrete culture, cuisine and often language.  Chances are they just don't like one ingredient but don’t know what it is.  Trying two dishes and writing off the entire subcontinent’s food is potentially depriving an individual of an opportunity to find dishes they like, leading them to Indian restaurants, meeting Indian staff there and thereby gaining a small chance at some understanding and cultural appreciation.  </p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Initially, the application will have two types of user: diners and restaurants.   However, this could be extended to include other types of user such as bakeries and grocery stores and adapted so as to introduce dishes that can be prepared at home, perhaps even linking to cookery books.  Ideally, the application would actively alert users when there was an opportunity to try something new nearby.</p>
<p>The application will need to gather some basic information from diners: likes, dislikes, favourite dishes, textures and such.  Restaurants can either upload individual dishes or select dishes that they serve from a generic list.  When a diner sees a restaurant they are interested in trying they enter details and potential menu options are displayed for that diner.  If restaurants have not uploaded their menu, the generic menu will be applied, suggesting dishes from that cuisine that the user may find enjoyable.  After a set period, the application asks for feedback.  This then updates the user’s profile and feeds back to a remote database to influence recommendations for all users.</p>
<p>For example, Sunil from Mumbai is strolling down a street in London.  He passes a store selling Albanian food, something they have never tried, or really thought of doing so.  The customers and staff in the store are speaking in a language Sunil does not understand so although he’s hungry he is hesitant to go into the store and purchase anything.  In this situation, the application could note that Sunil is a fan of the Indian sweet ‘jalebi’ and alert him to the existence of an Albanian dessert called ‘tulumba’.  This could be either through comparing ingredients or from noting that other users who like jalebi also enjoyed tulumba.  Sunil enjoys discovering a new food he wouldn’t have otherwise and the store owners are alerted to a potential market for their product they were previously unaware of.  A short while after, Sunil is prompted to provide feedback on tulumba and the application notes that he enjoyed it and so may enjoy other dishes with this taste profile as well as sending the data back to a server where the match between jelebi and tulumba is reinforced.</p>
<p>Of course, while the overall motivation is not financial, the cost of development and operation of the service will need to be considered and an attempt to recover this made.  I do not believe that with the proposed model it would operate well as software that the user pays for primarily as this would mean fewer users and therefore less opportunity for data capture.  Advertising on the application as a free version with the option for a paid and advertisement free upgrade, although not a sophisticated model, appears to be a sensible option.</p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>Very little would be needed in terms of tools, users are likely to already have the equipment they need, smart phones and computers.  The data that the application uses will need to be stored on a server and updated/amended as necessary.  Some form of validation check will also be required so that unhelpful suggestions are not made, perhaps through AI.  Whatever the system, it would need to be able to identify matches made that are unlikely.  However, it may be beneficial to store these as an unexpected pattern may develop.  Cybersecurity and data protection would also need to be considered.</p>
<h2>Skills required</h2>
<p>Programming. An individual or group to write the front end for both mobile and desktop and the  back end</p>
<p>Legal.  Terms of use etc.  The last thing the application would want would be to be considered liable for a user suffering an allergic reaction as a result of its use</p>
<p>Marketing.  Developing the service alone is not enough, if people haven’t heard of it they won’t use it.  They will also need to be convinced that it has enough benefit to try using it.</p>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>I would consider the project to be a success if the application is used by a reasonable number of people and that if it were profitable it would be a bonus.  The desired outcome is to get people to try food from parts of the world that they otherwise wouldn’t and thereby increase their exposure to foreign cultures without necessarily altering their physical location.  With that being considered, a target number of users who accept information from the service occasionally would be more relevant than considering those who use the application frequently.</p>
