  <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
   <p>A few years ago, I undertook a Myers-Briggs test as part of a wider evaluation.  I was able to find the results and compare them to the test on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">16personalities</a>.  Interestingly, the results were quite different and I am left wondering whether knowing what the test outcome would likely be based on the questions influenced my answers.  Anyway, 16personalities has me down as INFJ, a diplomat who strives for constant improvement.  The test I had undertaken previously catogorised me as INTP, an independent problem solver who is likely to excel in detached concise analysis of a situation or problem.  So definitely introvert, something I have become more comfortable with since first taking a Meyers-Briggs test.</p>

<p>I’m not a particularly visual person, I became aware of this studying in my early 20s.  My cohort took thorough notes in lectures and I did so before I realised that I didn’t read them and that writing things down and reading them later didn’t help me learn.  I had been reading textbooks aloud and recording myself doing so, I found often I didn’t need to listen to the recording, only know that I needed to read in a manner that could be understood.  I almost felt lazy when I discovered that several of my friends were not only taking thorough notes in lectures but then going home to copy them out repeatedly.  I recall not long after meeting my wife I was struggling to remember which vitamins are fat soluble, I’d been writing them down repeatedly and it just wouldn’t stick. she said ‘that’s easy, just remember zadek, A.D.E.K. Czech for bum, fat soluble, fat bum’. I thought, that’s not going to work, I don’t speak a word of Czech but I’ve never forgotten.  Considering teamwork, I think that my learning style means that I am better to have oral conversations with people in order to understand what their perspectives and expectations are and that I should probably ask other team members to contribute more to visual elements of projects.  Ideally, in forming a team a balance of different strengths should be sought and knowing the way in which each member absorbs information best could well make work more efficient.</p>
