<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>Born in Sydney, I enjoyed an international upbringing, including schooling in SE Asia and the UK.  After high school, I studied Pharmacy as it seemed a sensible choice and I had an interest in Science.  For several years after graduation I worked as a Pharmacist, predominantly freelance. During this time, I met my wife and we started a family.  Having an interest in the area and wanting to gain a more thorough understanding of how the world works, I studied for and gained a masters degree in international business law when the opportunity to do so presented itself.  In 2020, our family decided to ‘Brexit’ and moved to Brisbane to see what life back in Australia has to offer.</p>

<h2>Nationality and Culture</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family:courier;">Patriotism is the last refuge of a Scoundrel – Dr Johnson</p>
<p>Australian, Dutch/Australian family.  Generally select ‘white other’ on forms.
   Probably because of my upbringing I tend to be drawn towards Asian culture and foods.
   Scotland will always hold a special place in my heart</p>

   <h2>Education</h2>

   <p>Mpharm(Hons) – The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen UK</p>
    <p>LLM.LIB (Merit) – University of Liverpool</p>


    <h2>Languages </h2>
     <p>Only English really.  A few words in French, Thai and Gujarati but only just about enough to order a meal.  I’ve been learning Java for the past 3 months.</p>
