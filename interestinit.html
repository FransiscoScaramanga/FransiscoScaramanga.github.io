  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
   <p>I couldn’t say when my interest in IT started.  I’ve always been interested in problem solving and developments in technology but haven’t found the time to explore this.  Often I have found myself wondering whether I could have designed an application I work with better or whether I could create something that would do this or that at work.  A few times I have taken these things a bit further but nothing has gone too far, I feel that if I develop myself I’ll be able to carry these and other projects further.</p>
    <p>I decided to study Intro to IT at RMIT after enjoying Intro to Programming.  I originally undertook this as I had no experience in programming and didn’t know whether it was something I would enjoy.  Turns out that I did and so a natural progression was to continue on to IT.  I’m hoping to gain a thorough understanding of the digital world.  I feel I have a useful understanding of healthcare and law and would like to say the same of IT.</p>

    <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
    <p align:center><a href="https://jobs.lever.co/kitware/8a416262-03cb-4cd0-873f-745ed34316f4">Software Developer - Medical Computing</a></p>
     <p>One of the reasons that I have an interest in studying IT is that I have had several ideas that I would like to develop and I have found that, although I’ve been told the ideas aren’t difficult to develop, I have struggled to find people who are actually able to deliver what I have asked in a professional manner and at a fair price.  Ideally, I would like to fill that void for others, drawing on my experience as a healthcare professional, be that as part of a larger organisation or otherwise.  Of course, I expect that over the course of my studies, I may develop other interests and my ideal role could change accordingly.</p>
      <p>The position advertised is that of a software developer, working with image analysis, visualization and simulation in the medical field.  This job appeals to me as it seems a way of applying a skills that I am developing to a field that I am more familiar with.  The position advertised appears to be one that has scope for a great deal of development, which I consider important as a lack of this is one of the factors behind me attempting a career switch.</p>
  <p>The skills required include a degree in a field related to computer science, software development experience and a GitHub portfolio, all things that I am currently working towards.
